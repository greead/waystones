Commanders are the leaders for a player's team. During teambuilding, players will need to select one of several Commanders to lead their units to victory. Each Commander has one or more special abilities and team restrictions that create unique gameplay around them. Commanders also may have additional resources that need to be managed.

**Abilities**:
Most Commanders will have a passive ability and an active ability to create unique gameplay. If a Commander has unique resources or other things to keep track of, it will appear as an ability. For example:
- Passive: Your units have +Movement.
- Passive: Your units with \[Flying] lose \[Flying] but gain +Power and +Defense.
- Passive: When an enemy unit dies, nearby ally units are healed.
- Passive: You may place your Commander on the board. They are spawned once every 3 waves.
- Passive: Your Commander tracks trophies on a golden cord of bones. Trophies are gained when enemy units are slain and are used by other abilities.
- Active: Launch a tactical fireball onto the board.
- Active: Disable an enemy structure for 2 waves.
- Active: Boost gold generation for 3 waves.
- Active: Instantly spawn a wave of weakened units.
- Active: Spend 2 trophies to field a \[Fading 2] unit.

**Restrictions:**
All Commanders have restrictions based on the *Alignment* of units that can be on their team. Commanders will generally only allow units from 1-2 alignments to be on your team. Additionally, some Commanders may have additional team restrictions such as requiring certain units to be on the team or restricting units with certain traits from being on the team.
