Units are the basis for any player's team. Each unit has the following stats:
- [[Alignments]] (A units "type")
- Power ("physical" damage stat)
- Defense (Defensive stat vs. Power)
- Magic ("magical" damage stat)
- Protection (Defensive stat vs. Magic)
- Health
- Movement (speed)
- Range
- Cost

**Abilities**
In addition, most units have special abilities. Some abilities are key abilities (common amongst multiple units) and others are special abilities (generally unique to a given unit). Abilities can have positive or negative effects which create very dynamic gameplay opportunities. Some examples are:
- Flying (keyword): This unit can only be damaged by ranged units.
- Fading X (keyword): After spawning in X waves, this unit is dismissed.
- Magic Consumer (special): When a nearby enemy unit attempts to activate an ability, instead counter it and give this unit a small +Power buff for short duration. This ability then goes on cooldown.
