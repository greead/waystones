## Teambuilding
Before getting into a match, players must build a team by choosing a Commander from a selection of [[Commanders]]. The chosen Commander helps determine the playstyle of the team. The chosen Commander will have one or more [[Alignments]] that will determine what kind of [[Units]], [[Structures]], and [[Relics]] can be added to the team.

When building a team, you choose your Commander then you add up to 10 units to your team, 4 structures, and 2 relics that alter your team.
