# Server
## Introduction
We need to decide what kind of server to create for the backend. I'd like to set up a situation with RPCs, a REST API, or WebSockets. We can use any kind of server for this purpose, but a lightweight server like Express.js, FastAPI, or Flask would be best. Alternatively, a nice GO server could be very good.

For databasing, I'd like to try an interesting solution using distributed SQLite databases. You can create a single central database and then have distributed SQLite databases for each game in progress. This is an interesting new topic that I'd like to investigate.
